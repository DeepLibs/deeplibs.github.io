<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
The current technology has the power to reshape society once more.
The recent developments in Artificial Intelligence will directly impact our daily
 lives and several studies indicate AI will have a great impact on jobs.
Like previous industrial revolutions job positions will cease to exist and
others will be created.
A <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/towards-a-reskilling-revolution">report</a>
 from the World Economic Forum says 1.4 million US jobs will be automated
 before 2026 and they believe the re-education is the solution to the impacted
 working force.
<!--Without re-education 16 percent of affected workers will have no job prospects.-->
<!--It is important to understand this tecnology and how it will change our daily lives.-->

<h3>What it is?</h3>
<p>
Deep learning is the field that studies any machine learning algorithm that
learns multiple levels of representation (abstraction).
Although this definition is very generic most successful solutions are entirely
based in neural networks.
Truthfully almost everything in deep learning was built around neural networks
and there is not much work with other machine learning algorithms.
The deep learning definition is still very controversial and since it is still
an area under development more time is required until a precise definition is
globally accepted.
</p>


<p>
Deep learning or deep neural networks are machine learning algorithms that
 require a dataset.
In turn, a dataset is a set of data examples and annotations (labels or ground
 truth) that must be carefully selected to represent a problem.
These annotations contain information that the model must learn or, precisely,
 annotations are exact representations that the model should output
 for a given input.
The annotation requirement place these models in the <b>supervised learning</b>
subcategory from machine learning.
</p>


<p>
Although we can use the technology we can hardly explain how it works.
The common approach right now is based on good practices followed by fine tuning
(adjusting) the model.
We have guides to teach what to do and network models exhaustively tested in
several datasets.
However, there is no mathematical description of deep neural networks
 internal computations.
These computations are <q>discovered</q> during a training process that uses the
 dataset.
With a better understanding we could be able to manually create networks for
 each problem selecting the number of layers and directly adjusting the weights
 without the need of training datasets.

<h3>What it can do?</h3>

<p>
From new products and services to new types of computer virus the list of
 possible AI applications is vast.
All major tech companies are heavily investing on AI powered products.
The most famous products are self-driving cars, search engines, recommendation
 systems, personal assistants (Alexa, Cortana, Google assistant, Siri) and
 domestic robots for household chores.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately this technology is not only being used for good.
Like the human intelligence, deep learning is dual-use and can be applied
 towards beneficial and harmful ends.
Also the same tools used to create AI products can also be used to create
 malicious applications.
The list of these malicous applications is also vast and include fake data
 generation (news, audio, image, videos), phishing attacks, autonomous weapon
 systems, software vulnerability discovery, hacking systems and surveillance
 platforms.

</p>

<p>
Self-driving cars are one of the main examples of AI powered products.
All major car manufactures are planning to release autonomous cars between 2019
and 2021.
The first impact of this technology is the replacement of taxi drivers and truck
 drivers.
Companies like Uber even have their own research team dedicated to self-driving
cars.

<!--AI will directly impact jobs in many different levels.-->
<!--Current research is being developed to use AI to create computer code.-->
<!--They are specially effective with descriptive languages like html and markdown.-->

<h3>Future perspectives</h3>

<p>
AI will challange our perception of reality.
Deep learning is able to generate realistic images and audio and they will
 likely revolutionize the audiovisual and gaming industry.
But most important we will have this power at our hands and we will be able to
 modify our surroundings generating fake images and audio.
Once this happens we will certainly face situations were it will not be possible
 to recognize what is real.
