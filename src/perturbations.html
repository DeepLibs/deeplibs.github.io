    <h1>Perturbations</h1>
    <br>


<p>
While we still really (really) far from creating skynet and the terminator we
should keep in mind real problems that rises with the current state of the art
in Artificial Intelligence.
</p>

<p>
<b>Perturbations</b> are one of the biggest threat to AI.
Basically a perturbation is any data or modification made in the input data with
the sole purpose is to jeopardise an expected outcome.
Perturbations can be subdivided in adversarial or universal.
</p>


<p>
These problems rise because we rely on datasets to train an AI model.
And of course, it is impossible to create a dataset that contemplates every
single possible entry a model can receive.
If we had a better understanding of deep neural networks we could create
efficient countermeasures to perturbations.
</p>



<p>
A fun fact is that it is not only possible to fool machines but many projects 
(or researches) are being explored to fool humans.
And it seems to be much easier to fool a human. 
For example: there is one research that can reproduce the voice of anyone 
including Barack Obama, and another "research" that can replace the face of 
anyone in any video.

These tasks are not new but the results obtained by the use of AI are
impressive.
