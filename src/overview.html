    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <br>

<p>
The current technology has the power to reshape society once more.
Several studies evaluate AI will have a great impact on jobs.
Like previous industrial revolutions job positions will cease to exist and
others will be created.
Since AI will directly impact our daily life it is important to understand what
it is and how this tecnology will change our routine.
<!--If we understand it we can prepare ourselves for the changes and make part of-->
<!--them.-->

<h3>What it is?</h3>
<p>
Deep learning is the field that studies any machine learning algorithm that
learns multiple levels of representation (abstraction).
Although this definition is very generic most successful solutions are entirely
base in neural networks.
Truthfully almost everything in deep learning was built around neural networks
and there is not much work with other machine learning algorithms.
The deep learning definition is still very controversial and since it is still
an area under development more time is required until a precise definition is
globally accepted.
</p>


<p>
Deep learning or deep neural networks are machine learning algorithms
that require a dataset and annotations (labels or ground truth).
These annotations contain information that the model must learn.
Precisely, they are exact representations that the model should output.
The annotation requirement place these models in the supervised learning
subcategory from machine learning.
</p>


<p>
Although we can use the technology we can hardly explain how it works.
The common approach right now is based on good practices followed by fine tuning
(adjusting) the model.
We have guides to teach what to do and network models exhaustively tested in
several datasets.
However there are no formal mathematical description of deep
neural networks for specific problems.
In the ideal case we would be able to manually create networks for each problem,
selecting the number of layers and directly adjusting the weights without the
need of datasets to training them.

<h3>What it can do?</h3>

<p>
One great change that is a direct consequence of AI will be the self-driving
cars.
All major car manufactures are planning to release autonomous cars between 2019
and 2021.
The first impact of this technology is the replacement of taxi drivers.
Companies like Uber even have their own research team to develop self-driving
cars.
</p>


<p>
AI can even directly impact jobs in TI.
Current research is being developed to use AI to create computer code.
They are specially effective with descriptive languages like html and markdown.
