<h1>Diving into deep learning</h1>

<p>
The current developments in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> have the potential to
transform our society.
Several recently published researches could endow the computer with superhuman
habilities.
And since these researches are still in early stages much more advancements are
expected in a near future.
</p>

<p>
<!--Neural networks are in the spotlight of the current artificial intelligence revolution.-->
AI is migrating from solutions built over sets of rules, or symbolic AI, to
 solutions that extract information over sets of data, or distributed
 representations
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O01G3tSYpU&list=LLSyr8YVKU846mBdmQ0Qf31Q&index=3">DARPA AI perspective</a>).
The current availability of data and computational resources allowed researches
to create and train machine learning algorithms of several abstraction levels,
thus the name <b>deep learning</b>.
These models are able to extract meaningful information from large amounts of
data and currently present the best results in image, audio and text processing
(<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539">deep learning survey</a>).
</p>

<p>
Deep learning is currently presenting results at the same level of humans or
 even better (superhuman).
Although the results are good there are several problems the current AI
 solutions are facing.
One specific problem is that these models can be easily tricked (or hacked), see
 <a href="appendix/perturbations.html">Perturbations</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although the excitement is justified we are still far from
skynet and the terminator.
An artificial general intelligence (AGI) that represents machines with
consciousness is far from happening.
However, there are several other problems that emerge from the current
 technological power, see the <a href="chapters/overview.html">Overview</a>
 section for a discussion about malicious use of AI.
</p>

<p>
This website presents a series of explanations over basic concepts related to
deep learning.
We focus on image applications, therefore most models are Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN).
The main idea is to present the concepts and simple code in Python to clarify
 how these models are implemented.
The appendix presents discussions on specific or advanced topics.
