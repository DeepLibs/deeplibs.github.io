        <h1>Diving into deep learning</h1>

        <br>

<p>
The current developments in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> have the potential to
transform our society.
Several researches recently published could endow the computer with superhuman
habilities.
Since these researches are still in early stages much more advancements are
expected in a near future.
</p>

<p>
<!--Neural networks are in the spotlight of the current artificial intelligence revolution.-->
AI is migrating from solutions built over sets of rules (symbolic AI) to
solutions that extract information over sets of data (distributed representations)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O01G3tSYpU&list=LLSyr8YVKU846mBdmQ0Qf31Q&index=3">[1]</a>.
The current availability of data and computational resources allowed researches
to create and train machine learning algorithms of several abstraction levels,
thus the name <b>deep learning</b>.
These models are able to extract meaningful information from large amounts of
data and currently present the best results in image, audio and text processing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539">[2]</a>.
</p>

<p>
AI is currently presenting results at the same level of humans or even better
(superhuman) but although the excitement is justified we are still far from
skynet and the terminator (working on it, sorry Elon Musk).
An artificial general intelligence (AGI) that represents machines with
consciousness is far from happening.
However, there are several problems the current AI solutions are facing.
For an overview of these problems refer to
<a href="src/perturbations.html">Perturbations</a>.
</p>

<p>

This website presents a series of explanations over basic concepts related to
deep learning.
We focus on image applications, therefore most models are Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN).
The main idea is to present the concepts and simple implementation code in
Python to clarify how AI solutions really works.
The appendix presents discussions on specific topics without much mathematics.
