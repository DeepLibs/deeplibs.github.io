        <h1>Diving into deep learning</h1>

        <br>

        <p>
        Neural networks are in the spotlight of the current artificial
        intelligence revolution. We are migrating from intelligent solutions
        built over a set of rules to solutions that extract information over
        sets of data <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O01G3tSYpU&list=LLSyr8YVKU846mBdmQ0Qf31Q&index=3">[1]</a>.
        The current avaliability of data and computational resources allowed
        researches to create and train neural networks of several layers,
        hence the name deep learning.
        </p>



        <p>
        These networks are able to extract meaningful information from large
        amounts of data and currently present the best results in image, audio
        and text processing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539">[2]</a>.
        These results are at the same level of humans
        or even better (superhuman) but although the excitement is justified we
        are still far from skynet and the terminator (working on it).
        </p>

        <p>
        This website presents a series of explanations over basic concepts
        related to artificial neural networks. The main idea is to present the
        concepts and simple implementation code in python to
        clarify how neural network really works.
